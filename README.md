# Odin Project Ruby Computer Science  

Projects dealing with implementing and using various data sctructures and alogrithms in Ruby    

Project topics included:   
Recursive functions, merge_sort, linked lists, binary search trees 

 
BST is unfinished. I wrote a the initial fuction to build a balanced BST and insert.  
Just implementing delete correctly could have a high time requirement for me currently   

Delete notes:     
  # Going to skip implementing this, I understand the difficulty in reconnecting all  
  # the children nodes back behind the deleted node. This could take a while for me to figure  
  # out and implement solutions for all cases. May try in the future.  
  # 1. target has no children  
  # 2. target has left child  
  # 3. target has right child  
  # 4. target has both children ---this will be the worst one  

I now understand the basics of BST. Will return to studying more deeply in the future as needed.
